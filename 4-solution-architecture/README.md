I designed it to each service by this

| **Service Name**         | **Responsibilities**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Service**         | - User authentication and authorization. <br>- Connection with a relational database (e.g., SQL).                                                                                           |
| **Content Service**      | - Content uploading. <br>- Resizing and reformatting of photos and videos. <br>- Metadata storage in a scalable database (e.g., MongoDB).                                                   |
| **Feed Service**         | - Aggregation and sorting of content for each user based on preferences. <br>- Caching for improved performance. <br>- Real-time updates using WebSocket.                                   |
| **Interaction Service**  | - Management of likes and comments on content. <br>- Notification of content owners for interactions. <br>- Asynchronous processing using a message queue.                                  |
| **Messaging Service**    | - Implementation of a generic chat system. <br>- Real-time communication using WebSockets.                                                                                                  |
| **Notification Service** | - Sending notifications to users via mobile push notifications and email. <br>- Integration with external notification providers (e.g., Firebase).                                          |
| **Analytics Service**    | - Collection and analysis of content views and interactions. <br>- Daily report generation and email delivery. <br>- Utilization of a data warehouse for analytics (e.g., Google BigQuery). |

## Pros and Cons

| **Aspect**               | **Pros**                                                      | **Cons**                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**          | - Independent scaling of services.<br>- Improved performance. | - Increased complexity in orchestration.             |
| **Flexibility**          | - Technology stack flexibility for each service.              | - Potential for inconsistencies in tech stacks.      |
| **Parallel Development** | - Simultaneous development by different teams.                | - Integration challenges during development.         |
| **Resilience**           | - Service isolation prevents system-wide failures.            | - Requires robust error handling and monitoring.     |
| **Complexity**           | - Simplifies individual service development.                  | - Increases overall system complexity.               |
| **Operational Overhead** | - Easier management of individual services.                   | - Requires effective orchestration and monitoring.   |
| **Latency**              | - Improved performance through independent services.          | - Inter-service communication may introduce latency. |

## risks and extensibility

| **Aspect**                | **Risks**                                                   | **Extensibility Strategies**                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Consistency**      | - Ensuring consistency in distributed transactions.         | - Implement transactional mechanisms.<br>- Use event sourcing for data consistency.         |
| **Security**              | - Ensuring secure communication and protection of services. | - Regular security audits and updates.<br>- Implement secure communication protocols.       |
| **Dependency Management** | - Impact of changes in one service on others.               | - Careful versioning and dependency management.<br>- API gateways for seamless integration. |
